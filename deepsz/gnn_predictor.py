"""Lightweight, dimension-agnostic GNN predictor for the DeepSZ closed loop.

Same interface as the other predictors (see predictor.py):
    predict(recon, known) -> pred
with recon float32 (C, *S) in original units, known bool (*S). It is a pure
function of (recon * known, known), so encoder and decoder reproduce it
bitwise. `S` may be any spatial shape of any rank; the network's weights are
shared across directions, so a model trained on 2-D images runs unchanged on
n-D grids.

Design (single hop; long-range context comes from the codec's hierarchical
stage schedule, which progressively densifies `known`):

  * for every *line* through a point (the (3^n - 1)/2 axis and diagonal
    directions) find the nearest known sample on each side;
  * store one embedding per lattice axis at every point. Per axis k
    independently, concatenate a small learned direction-state vector to each
    neighbour's axis-k embedding, indexed by the signed direction cosine
    cos(line direction, axis k) — a handful of discrete values (DirState) — so
    the axis-k channel reads its neighbours through their angle to axis k;
  * turn a two-sided pair into a trend/curvature message (BiDirEmbed) or a
    one-sided neighbour into an extrapolation message (DirEmbed);
  * pool the per-line messages into one context per axis with single-query
    attention, then pool axes with a second single-query attention before
    reading out a Laplacian mean/scale (PredHead), conditioned on the
    normalized error bound;
  * once a point's own value is revealed — known, but carrying the small error
    left by residual coding — embed it with InitEmbed and fuse it into the
    per-axis contexts with MixEmbed to form that point's finalized embeddings
    (the ones stored in the propagating field). In training the revealed value
    is the truth plus noise, so MixEmbed learns to trust it only up to that
    error.

Axes never mix during propagation; direction enters only as the concatenated
direction-state embedding, so with that table zeroed every axis channel is
identical — the axial structure is a pure inductive bias layered on the
direction-blind model.

        The model is single-hop (long range comes from the codec's stage
        schedule, not composed message-passing hops), and the lines are lattice
        directions, so the signed direction cosine ``sign * cos(line, axis k)``
        is not a continuous position — it takes one of a small, fixed set of
        values. A line of L1 length ``j`` (``j`` non-zero components) has
        ``|cos| = 1/sqrt(j)`` on its non-zero axes and 0 elsewhere, so over an
        aggregation level ``L`` the whole set is ``{+-1/sqrt(j) : j=1..L} u {0}``
        — ``2L + 1`` states. A learned table indexed by that state is both
        cheaper than the rotation (no per-channel sin/cos on the finest level,
        the bulk of the forward) and strictly more expressive than a fixed
        phase. The axis-k channel still reads its neighbours through their angle
        to axis k — now as a concatenated feature the message MLP may use freely
        — and perpendicular axes (the center state) get a distinct learned
        vector rather than the identity rotation.

        The ``2L + 1`` states are ordered by signed cosine ascending:
        ``-1, -1/sqrt2, .., -1/sqrt(L), 0, +1/sqrt(L), .., +1/sqrt2, +1`` at
        indices ``0..2L`` (center = L). ``nnz = round(1/v**2)`` recovers a
        pair's L1 length from its cosine, giving index ``2L-nnz+1`` (v>0),
        ``nnz-1`` (v<0), ``L`` (v==0). ``L`` is fixed by the checkpoint's
        aggregation level, and geometry is built at the same level, so every
        pair's ``nnz`` lands in ``[1, L]`` (the clamp is only a guard). Zeroing
        the table makes every axis channel identical again — the axial structure
        stays a pure, removable inductive bias (as the freq bank was)."""
